# Lance's VGC Display
------------------------
This tool allows you to paste your VGC Teams through a Showdown Paste and have it be displayed neatly for all your viewers to see!
They'll be able to hover and inspect all relevant information of your Pokémon, so that they themselves can accompany your team and understand it better!

Later updates will include:
- Horizontal Display
- Moveable Display
- Support for Pokémon Champions (formes)
- More!

Thank you for supporting!
